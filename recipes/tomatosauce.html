    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sugo di Pomodoro Fresco or Fresh Tomato Sauce in English is the perfect use for tomatoes in season. When using fresh ripe summer tomatoes not much else is needed. One of the biggest mistakes I see novice culinarians making is making recipes that are simply to complicated.</p>
    <p>This is a very simple and easy to prepare recipe where the most important step is selecting top quality ingredients. My top suggestion would be to use home grown ingredients, especially the tomatoes and the basil, the rest of the ingredients are of lesser importance. Using home grown ingredients allows you to pick them at their pick ripeness. If you don't have a garden the Farmers market should give you nearly the same quality.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs (about 900g) fresh ripe tomatoes (roma or plum work well but not necessary)</li>
        <li>3 cloves fresh garlic, minced</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh basil leafs</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Blanch the tomatoes:</strong>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Score a small "X" on the bottom of each tomato. Boil them for 30-60 seconds, then transfer them to an ice bath. Peel off the skins and chop the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the garlic:</strong>In a pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant (don’t let it brown).</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer the tomatoes:</strong>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Stir and let them simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong>Tear and stir in the fresh basil. Add salt to taste and freshly ground black pepper if you’d like.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Toss with cooked pasta, use on pizza, or store in the fridge for later.</li>
    </ol>
