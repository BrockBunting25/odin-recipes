    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegan carbonara is a plant-based twist on the traditional Italian pasta dish, known for its rich and creamy texture. While classic carbonara uses eggs, cheese, and pancetta, this vegan version relies on cashews, plant milk, and nutritional yeast to create a velvety sauce full of umami flavor. Smoked paprika and miso paste help to mimic the savory depth of the original dish, while optional vegan bacon or smoked tempeh adds a satisfying, smoky bite.</p>
    <p>This dairy-free and egg-free carbonara is comforting, flavorful, and simple to prepare, making it a perfect choice for weeknight dinners or special occasions. Tossed with your favorite pasta and finished with a generous grind of black pepper, it’s a satisfying take on an Italian classic—no animal products needed.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup raw cashews (soaked for 4 hours or boiled for 10 minutes)</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika (for a subtle bacon-like flavor)</li>

    </ul>
