    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto is a classic Italian sauce originating from Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy. Traditionally made by crushing fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and extra virgin olive oil using a mortar and pestle, pesto offers a vibrant, aromatic blend of flavors. The name “pesto” comes from the Italian word pestare, meaning “to pound” or “to crush,” reflecting its original preparation method.</p>
    <p>Today, pesto is widely used as a versatile condiment, most commonly served with pasta, but also spread on sandwiches, drizzled over roasted vegetables, or stirred into soups. While the classic Genovese version remains the most popular, modern variations use ingredients like arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, or walnuts to create unique twists on this fresh and savory sauce.</p>
